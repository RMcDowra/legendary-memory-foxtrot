        <p class="card-text">I was a big fan of pro wrestling as a kid, like most I fell out of it with age. However, during the COVID-19 Pandemic there were few selective shows that were still had weekly live shows. Those two promotions were WWE (Monday Night Raw, NXT, and Friday Night Smackdown) and AEW (Wednesday Night Dynamite and Friday Night Collision) <br> </br> Watching those two promotions got me back into the world of pro wrestling and made me have a new love for it. Since then I have gone to multiple shows, PPVs and have met wrestlers. <br> </br>Two of my favorites that are used in the pictures! </p>

I was even able to attend Game 3 of the 2021 World Series where the Braves won 2-0 against the Houston Astros and took a 2-1 Series lead. They went on to win the World Series for the first time since 1995. </p>

        <p class="card-text">As much as an overexgeration as it may be. Film was my first love as a child <br></br> I went to the theater pretty much every week as a kid. My mom would take me whenever there was something playing that I had interest in. Most of the time it was the newest Marvel movie that was coming out that year. <br></br> I still have my love for film to this day. I go to Huntsville when I can to watch whatever is playing and I also have a letterboxd account! <br></br> Which I will link here! </p>
